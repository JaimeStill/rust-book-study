# Rust Book Projects

Projects built working through the official [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). 

All directories, except for [hello_world](./hello_world), are created with cargo and can be executed by running `cargo run`. 

To run [hello_world](./hello_world), you must first run `rustc main.rs --out-dir ./target` to generate the **main** executable, then you can run `./target/main` directly from the command line.
